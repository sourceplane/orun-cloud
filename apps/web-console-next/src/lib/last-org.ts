/**
 * Last-used organization persistence.
 *
 * We remember the org slug the operator was last working in and use it as the
 * default landing target (app root + post-login), so returning users skip the
 * org picker and go straight to where they left off — the pattern used by
 * Vercel/Linear/GitHub for "last active workspace".
 *
 * Storage is client-side localStorage, consistent with how the session token
 * and API target are already persisted (see `session.tsx`). It's a low-
 * sensitivity hint (just a slug); a stale/invalid value self-heals because the
 * org list and `OrgScope` clear it when the slug isn't accessible.
 *
 * Upgrade path: when a per-user preferences API exists, this can be backed by
 * the server instead so the default follows the user across devices/browsers.
